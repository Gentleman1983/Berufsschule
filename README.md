# Berufsschule
Back to the old days. From August 2003 to June 2006 I went to the BBS2 Göttingen for the school part of my education.
I learned the job of an Informations- und Telekommunikations-System-Elektroniker, that's something like an 'IT system 
electronics technician'.

Back on those days, we learned basic coding on ANSI C and C++ and had database lessons using Microsoft Access and
Oracle DB. Here are some of those programs I found on my hard drive from that time.

Looking back today, it wasn't good code and not pretty, but maybe someone currently visiting that school will have
some déjà-vues when having a look to those programs.

As far as I know currently they are working with C# and Oracle DB.
